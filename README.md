A tool that takes a .pdf or .epub book and turns it into a .json file with clean, separated chapters.
It removes unwanted stuff like page numbers, the chapter name repeated every other page, and cleans up hyphenated line breaks. 
Works well for converting books into a more usable format for apps, summaries, or AI processing.
